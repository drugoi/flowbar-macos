# Cache Policy

FlowBar uses a manual cache policy for the MVP:
- Downloads are stored in `~/Library/Caches/FlowBar/`.
- There is no automatic eviction or size limit.
- Users can remove individual downloads or clear all downloads from the Utilities section.

If storage limits are added later, update this document and the UI copy.
