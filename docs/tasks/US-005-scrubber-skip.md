# US-005 Scrubber and Skip Controls

As a listener, I want a scrubber and skip controls so I can jump to the part of a long track I care about.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Now Playing includes a scrubber that reflects current time and duration.
- Dragging the scrubber seeks playback for both local and streaming.
- Skip forward/back buttons move by a fixed interval (for example 15s).
- Seeking updates persisted playback position.
- Controls are keyboard accessible.
