# US-001 Library Search and Filter

As a listener with a growing library, I want to search and filter my tracks by name so I can find and start playback quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Search field filters both Featured and My Library.
- Matching considers display name and resolved title.
- Filtering updates live as the user types.
- Empty state appears when no results match.
- Search does not alter the underlying library data.
