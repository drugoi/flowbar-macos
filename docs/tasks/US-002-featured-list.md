# US-002 Featured List

As a new user, I want a small featured list of ready-to-try tracks so I can start listening without adding my own URLs first.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Featured list appears above My Library and is labeled clearly.
- Featured items are non-editable (no rename/delete).
- Featured items can be played and downloaded like normal tracks.
- Featured list is bundled and available on first launch.
