# US-006 Playback Speed Control

As a listener, I want to adjust playback speed so I can listen faster or slower depending on the content.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Provide speed options (for example 0.75x, 1.0x, 1.25x, 1.5x).
- Default speed is 1.0x for all tracks.
- Speed applies to both local and streaming playback.
- Selected speed persists across app launches.
