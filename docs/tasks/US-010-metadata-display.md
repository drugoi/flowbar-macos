# US-010 Metadata Display

As a listener, I want to see resolved title and duration before downloading so I can decide whether a track is worth caching.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Resolve metadata on add and store resolved title and duration.
- Track rows display duration when available.
- If metadata resolution fails, the UI shows a friendly fallback.
- Metadata resolution does not block add flow or downloads.
